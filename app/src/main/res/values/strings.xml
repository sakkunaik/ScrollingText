        The Google company was officially launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to
        market Google Search, which has
        become the most widely used web-based search engine. Page and Brin, students at Stanford
        University in California,
        developed a search algorithm – at first known as – in 1996. The search engine soon proved successful and
        the expanding company moved several times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003. This marked a phase of rapid
        growth, with the company making its initial public offering
        in 2004 and quickly becoming one of the worls largest media companies. The company launched Google
        News in 2002,
        Gmail in 2004, Google Maps in 2005, Google Chrome in 2008, and the social network known as Google+ in 2011,

        The search engine went through numerous updates in attempts to combat search engine
        optimization abuse,
        provide dynamic updating of results, and make the indexing system
        rapid and flexible. Search results started to be personalized in 2005, and later Google Suggest
        autocompletion was introduced. From 2007 Universal Search provided all types of
        content, not just text content,
        in search results.
